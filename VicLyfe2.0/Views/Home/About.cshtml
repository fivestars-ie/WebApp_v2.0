                            Every year students come to Melbourne looking to build a professional career but when they
                            graduate they need a Permanent Residency to land a graduate job in most cases. Students with
                            no work experience are most affected as they are often short of 5 - 10 points. But now they
                            do not have to worry. Regional Victoria serves as a pathway for PR.

                            Considering the fact that moving from Melbourne to regional Victoria is not an easy decision,
                            we assist you with choosing the Region and City which is most suitable for you considering
                            your basic needs. We provide you a comparison of the Regional cities with Melbourne to give
                            you a basic idea of how good the quality of life there is.
                            Regional Victoria has 5 Regions: Loddon Mallee, Barwon South West, Gippsland, Grampians, Hume
                            Regional Victoria has 10 Cities: Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo, Horsham, Latrobe, Mildura, Shepparton,
                            Wangaratta, Warrnambool, Wodonga.
                            Compare between these or compare them with Melbourne to find out which suits you.
